Quiz Game (True/False)

This is a simple command-line quiz application built using Python. The program asks the user a series of True/False questions and keeps track of the score throughout the quiz. At the end, it displays the final result based on the user's answers.

The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming by creating a Question class to represent each quiz question. The raw question data is stored as a list of dictionaries and then converted into Question objects. The quiz logic iterates through each question, collects user input, checks the answer, and updates the score accordingly.
